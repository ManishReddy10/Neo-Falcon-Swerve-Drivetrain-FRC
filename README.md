THIS CODE DOES NOT WORK!!!!! 
While I was debugging this code I came accross yet another generic swerve library (YAGSL) and managed to successfuly create working code for it
You can find the successful implementation of YAGSL with a neo angle falcon drive motor swerve drive on the 2024-Neo-Falcon-SwerveChassey branch of this repo: https://github.com/ManishReddy10/YAGSL-2024-ExampleCode

Swerve drivetrain with
-  MK4 Modules 
-  L2 Gear Ratio 
-  Falcon Drive Motors 
-  Neo Angle Motors 
-  CANcoder magnetic encoders
-  Pigeon 2.0 ➖ (Added code need to test)
-  Chassey Dimensions  (Trackwidth meters and Wheelbase meters variables)
-  Calculate Each Modules Angle Offset ❌
-  Path Planning ❌
-  Simulation ❌
